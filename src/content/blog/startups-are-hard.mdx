Everyone tells you that startups are 10x harder than working any other run-of-the-mill office job, but no one tells you what shape that difficulty takes.

I've frequently seen startup founders on various social media platforms (X/Reddit) boasting about the incredible hours they've put in or the intensely complicated problems they have to solve.

Both of these difficulties can be seen in any other job or form of work, so there isn't a definitive difference between the "hard" work in a regular job and the "hard" work in a startup. 

So why is it that people constantly say startups are so difficult?

Personally, I've discovered that it's the uncertainty and the stress.

Now, I wouldn't consider myself to be someone prone to getting stressed out or having a fear of uncertainty, but today has been a day of awakening.

When everything hinges on **you**, it becomes a different story. You begin to overthink and worry about each decision you make, leading to procrastination and mental blocks forming. 

For the past 15 or so days, I have been 100% dedicated to pushing out the MVP, committing code every single day without fail, with each commit producing an intense amount of output. 

Not once had I considered burn out or any sort of momentum slowing down

It's now that I've come to realize the value of a mentor.
